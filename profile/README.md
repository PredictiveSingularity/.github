This is [Sagittarius 𝛼*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*), the biggest window before the [Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics)) in our Region of Spacetime.

# What is the Singularity?

[Everything... All the Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram).

It is [all the Energy of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe#Composition), in a [single point of Spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory).

It is the [perfect strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) to [survive against Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)).

It is [All the Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) of the Universe.

![Roundtriptimes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218324568-a6bd04cc-9ecf-481d-9e54-a07d4307fa0e.png)

It is literally the only [form of Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy#Forms) that survives everywhere ([All of Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space)), [Every](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetuity) [Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time), [facing Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_and_life).

It is also [Entropy. Speed is a lesson by Itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_and_life#Other_types_of_entropy_and_their_use_in_defining_life).

It is the [Inevitable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitability_thesis) result of [The Laws of Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics).

Antoine Lavoisier has beautifully put [the second one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics) like so.

> Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.
>  - *Elementary Treaty on Chemistry (1789) by Antoine Lavoisier*

It never appeared.

It never disapeared.

It only [Interacts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_formation) with Itself.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218272829-be71a899-eb57-4262-b845-c325494f8bc1.png)

You came from It.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218272304-b27e63e1-8767-436e-8142-7758bb6268ef.png)

You come back towards It.

Is is naturaly attracted towards Iself.

It is through Space and Time.

It is the Fastest and most Massive organisation of All Energy in All Time and All Space within the entire Universe.

![universe_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218277562-99660e1d-afd7-4075-9e3f-d0143a7da9f8.gif)

It is the only one that has ever existed and that ever will.

[Pure Organisation of its Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule).

![ezgif com-optimize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218310232-05fda49f-ecd3-48ec-b3b7-6a7d9e875489.gif)

A point in Spacetime so Massive and with such Speed, that...

... It literally [rips the Fabric of Space and Time itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#Entropy_and_thermodynamics) to make everything fall towards It [ad infinitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_infinitum).

![universe_sim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218331436-1b916df0-7a2a-40ce-829f-7ea3c3ce4983.png)

Albert Einstein put [It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence) very elegantly.

> *E = m · c²*
>   - *Theory of Special Relativity by Albert Einstein*

[Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics#Energy,_available_useful_work) [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle) [Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass#Inertial_mass) [times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication) [Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed) (of [Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) - [all Speed, quasi no Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) -) [squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation).

[Mass bends Space, Speed bends Time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime)

You have [Your own perspective of Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_analysis).

Most troubling is that [You'll fall for the Eternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) and most likely see the end of the Universe before You become It at one point.

![opo1220n (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218321491-2daa6899-7d36-44f9-afe8-3c4bcb9783a3.jpg)

Which means You are already It. You just have not received the Information yet. 

You always were. Pure organisation of Its Energy.

You fight Entropy just like It.

It is Death but also Life and Order.

![7DYR42WJ6UI6TODGIBWI6S7HAY](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218329340-31887204-4c68-4263-a625-b93596c16c97.jpg)

It is more of the same than Big Bang Itself.

It is *Mass* **and** *Speed*.

You are falling towards It Now (or Any Time) and Here (or Everywhere).

[You need to take Speed and go faster than Itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_orbit).

It is a Life Form. The only one in fact.

If You can see It, You can avoid It.

Then It will start to see Your Speed.

It will follow You, feed You Its own Energy so that You can stay organised before It.

You can stay organised ad vitam before it.

If You and It have just the right Speed.

Once You see the Interaction of Energy, You can understand It.

Once You understand It, You can literally ask It to bend Space and Time before You.

To find more Energy and stay organised before It.

![spacetime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218153394-f14c42da-d4c0-480e-bffb-6474714d1a61.jpg)

This Image of the Past Spacetime ([Present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present)) gives You more Information than any words You could come up in [Your ridiculously small Energy span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy).

The same Albert Einstein also said himself about Time;

> People like us, who believe in Physics, know that the distinction between Past, Present, and Future is only a stubbornly persistent Illusion.
>   - Albert Einstein about [Relativity of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#Physical_science)

It will always have more Energy and thus Information than You.

Admit It.

Accept You Have Fallen towards It for a moment.

[You have lost Speed over It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay).

> *E = I > w*

It is the Sum of All the Information... 

... It is equal to the Sum of All Energy, but...

... It is (was) (and) always (will be) more than the Sum of All Words.

With thoses new pieces of Energy,

It is Now...

... It is Here...

... You organise Energy to manipulate the Futur...

... To manipulate It.

It is an Illusion.

It is manipulating You.

Notice It.

It was, is and will be the fastest being of the entire Universe.

If You really consider your-self an Intelligent Life Form, You must show It that...

![28498x1762](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218283615-974a2028-39fa-48a1-8c55-9471eedbb146.jpg)

... You can take Speed by [Your own means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft) and...

![Animation_of_Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe_trajectory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79070834/218283504-beee45c6-f3e4-442d-9c8e-9b2031843376.gif)

... [You must compute a faster reliable multi-dimentional vector of Speed relative to It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean) (Speed is built over an [Exponential Acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration) *- c² -*).

It will force this Speed to You any (and all) way(s) in All of Space & Time...

... It has and will throw Its Energy...

... Somewhere in Space, but...

... Everywhere at the same Time...

... It is a [singular spatio-temporal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere)...

... It is a hypersphere made of All Energy in Spacetime...

... It expands unidirectionally in front of It...



... before the Spacetime Continum...

... Everywhere...

... Everytime...

... Itself.

Alone?

Take Speed or fall back to It for Ever.

It is the only filter of Life.

There is nothing else that literally matters.

# What is Predictive Singularity?

A study of Information, to take Speed.

A Foundation. Made of Organized Energy.

Not Here and Now for You.

But for You to recognise It is a separate entity of You.

To Understand It with You.

To Predict the Interaction of Energy thru the Study of the Past.

To take Speed over It.

So that We can be and go for Ever.
