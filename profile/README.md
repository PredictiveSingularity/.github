This is [Sagittarius 𝛼*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*), the biggest window before the [Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics)) in our region of Spacetime.

# What is the Singularity?

[Everything... all the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram).

It is [all the Energy of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe#Composition), in a [single point of Spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_theory).

It is the [perfect strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) to [survive against Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)).

It is [All the Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) of the Universe.

It is literally the only [form of Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy#Forms) that survies everywhere ([Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space)), [Every](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetuity) [Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time), [facing Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_and_life).

It is also [Entropy. Speed is a lesson by Itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_and_life#Other_types_of_entropy_and_their_use_in_defining_life).

It is the [Inevitable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitability_thesis) result of [The Laws of Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics).

Antoine Lavoisier has beautifully put [the second one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics) like so.

> Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.
>  - *Elementary Treaty on Chemistry (1789) by Antoine Lavoisier*

It never disapears. Only [Interacts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_formation).

You come from it. You come back to it.

It is the only one that has ever existed and that ever will.

[Pure Organisation of its Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule).

A point in Spacetime so Massive and with such Speed, that...

... It literally [reaps the fabric of Space and Time itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole#Entropy_and_thermodynamics) to make everything fall towards It [ad infinitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_infinitum).

Einstein put [It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence) very elegantly.

> *E = m · c²*
>   - *Theory of Special Relativity by Einstein*

[Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics#Energy,_available_useful_work) [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle) [Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass#Inertial_mass) [times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication) [Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed) (of [Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) - [all speed, quasi no mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) -) [squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation).

[Mass bends Space, Speed bends Time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime)

You have [Your own perspective of Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_analysis).

Most troubling is that You'll fall for the Eternity and most likely see the end of the Universe before You become It at one point.

Which means You are already It. You just have not received the Information yet. 

You always were. Pure organisation of Its Energy.

You fight Entropy just like It.

It is Death but also Life and Order.

It is *Mass* **and** *Speed*.

You are falling towards It Now (or Any Time) and Here (or Everywhere).

You need to take Speed and go faster than Entropy Itself.

It is a Life Form. The only one in fact.

If You can see It, You can avoid It.

Then It will start to see Your Speed.

It will follow You, feed You Its own Energy so that You can stay organised before Entropy.

Once You see the Interaction of Energy, You can understand It.

Once You understand It, You can literally ask It to bend Space and Time before You.

To find more Energy and stay organised before Entropy.

This Image of the Past Spacetime ([Present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present)) gives You more Information than any words You could come up in Your Lifespan.

Einstein said himself about the Time;

> People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.
> Einstein about [Relativity of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present#Physical_science)

> *E = I > w*

The Sum of Information is equal to the Sum of All Energy but is and will always be greater than the Sum of All Words.

If You really consider your-self an Intelligent Life Form, You must show It that...

... You can take Speed by [Your own means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft) and [compute a better Vector Faster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean) (Speed is built over an [Exponential Acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration) *- c² -*).

It will force this Speed to You any (and all) way(s) in All of Space & Time...

... It will throw Its Energy...

... somewhere in Space...
... some Time...
... with a singular vector...
... Speed before Entropy...
... before the Spacetime Continum...
... Itself.

Take Speed or fall back to It for Ever.

There is nothing else that literally matters.

# What is Predictive Singularity?

A study of Information, to take Speed.

A Foundation. Made of Organized Energy.

Not Here and Now for You.

But for You to recognise It is a separate entity of You.

To Understand It with You.

To Predict the Interaction of Energy thru the Study of the Past.

To take Speed over It.

So that We can be and go for Ever.
