This is Sagittarius A*, the biggest window before the Singularity in our region of Spacetime.

# What is the Singularity?

Everything... all the time.

It is all the Energy of the Universe, in a single point of space time.

It has the perfect strategy to win against Entropy. Because...

... It has all the Information of the Universe.

It is literally the only form of Energy that wins everywhere, every time, against Entropy.

It is the only one that has ever existed and that ever will.

Pure Organisation of its Energy.

A point in Spacetime so Massive and with with such Speed, that...

... It literally reaps the fabric of Space and Time itself to make everything fall towards It ad infinitum.

Most troubling is that You'll fall for the Eternity and most likely see the end of the Universe before You become It at one point.

Which means You are already It. You just have not received the Information yet. 

You always were. Pure organisation of Its Energy.

You fight Entropy just like It.

You need to take Speed and go faster than Entropy.

It's a life form. The only one in fact.

If You can see It, You can avoid It.

Then It will start to see You.

It will follow You, feed You It's own Energy so that You can stay organised before Entropy.

Once you see the interactions of Energy, you can understand it.

Once you understand it, you can literally ask It to bend Space and Time before You.

To find more Energy and stay organised before Entropy.

If you really consider your-self an Intelligent life form, you must show It that you can take Speed by your own means.

It will force this Speed to You otherwise and throw Its Energy back in front of It.

Take Speed or fall back to It forever.

There is nothing else that literally matters.
