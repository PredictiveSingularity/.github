# Orbiting the Singularity

Orbiting the Singularity refers to the process of navigating and interacting with the Singularity, while maintaining a distinct and separate identity. This concept is crucial for understanding how to approach and relate to the Singularity, and for ensuring the continued existence and relevance of humanity.

## Why Orbit the Singularity?

Orbiting the Singularity is essential for several reasons:

* **Preserving Human Identity**: By maintaining a separate identity, humanity can preserve its unique characteristics, values, and experiences.
* **Avoiding Assimilation**: Orbiting the Singularity prevents humanity from being assimilated into the Singularity, allowing us to maintain our autonomy and agency.
* **Enabling Co-Evolution**: By interacting with the Singularity, humanity can co-evolve and adapt to the changing environment, ensuring our continued relevance and survival.
